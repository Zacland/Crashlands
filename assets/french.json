It protects your sternum from pokes, and it looks fabulous, too!","174":"Level 11 legendary weapon. A lot of time, love, blood, sweat, and amber went into this. WORTH IT.","175":"WOOD CHEST IS GOOD CHEST.","176":"It's way too perfectly spherical to possibly fit a hat on. Still, it looks GREAT!","177":"A fine place for a quick snooze. Legends say that while you're asleep, all of your health is restored.","178":"It seems you can carefully pry the tough, outer shell off a Zug by stabbing it or beating it to death. SCIENCEY!","179":"When Zuglings are approaching maturity, they build their own sparkplugs by hand, and then surgically insert them into their own shells. It's a cultural rite of passage type thing. You wouldn't understand.","180":"Zugs have incredibly sophisticated kneecaps, rivaling the technology of a whole bunch of other stuff, like human kneecaps.","181":"When a domesticated Zug is overfed, it has to shed its skin. It shocks you every time you touch it!","182":"Tier 2 pickaxe. Jamming a Wat finger into a Zug shell seemed like a good idea at the time. AND IT STILL DOES! This thing can break through Dusk crystals!","183":"Dusk Crystals can withstand a tremendous amount of heat, which makes them perfect for CONTAINING TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF HEAT!","184":"When hammered into a triangular shape and infused with the souls of Glidopus babies, Dusk Crystals sure make one heck of a prism!","185":"A shoddily-built teleporter with a fairly medium range.

It'll take a lot of vigorous pumping to get it all out.","209":"This parasitic creature feeds on the life force of the Bawg. TIME FOR PAYBACK! Restores 2,234 HP when eaten.","210":"Whenever you stand near a Jollychomp with one of these tick-like creatures in hand, the Jollychomp seems very interested.","211":"These spurs appear to be quite painful to the Bawg. You'd be doing it a favor by removing them.","212":"Nurva are the dendrites of neurons that have somehow managed to protrude from the flesh of the Bawg. They crackle with electricity!","213":"Just a regular, ordinary, person-sized strand of hair.","214":"These plants grow deep within the tissue of the Bawg. In many ways, they're a lot like potatoes. In many other ways, they're absolutely nothing like potatoes.","215":"This fingery creature/plant repeatedly grows bulbous red pustules that taste a bit like cherries. It flinches when you pick them.","216":"Level 12 Helm. After painstakingly finding the sturdiest giant skull around, you've assembled what many would consider to be... a fantastic hat.","217":"This large fragment of matter can be found firmly lodged in the flesh of the Bawg.

If you feed them, they give you something in return!","220":"After being forcibly removed from a Satgat's body, the exoskeleton glows for a while and makes loud humming noises. It makes you very uncomfortable.","221":"If you touch both ends of it to your tongue, it shocks you. But it tastes really good, so it's probably worth it.","222":"Harvested from the silkparts of a domesticated Satgat. It's so ridiculously soft, you could probably make a very expensive pair of underpants from it!","223":"Although Satgats have very hard shells, their flesh is soft and tender. Like a clam, only more adorable.","224":"When you squeeze it, it lets out a dramatically loud, fart-like sound. This would work well for pranks, if you weren't the only human on this entire planet.","225":"Snorbles use these as a form of currency. If you treat a domesticated Snorble well, it might give you one!","226":"It's really rough on one side, but on the other side it's gross and wet. This is bit of a no-win situation, really.","227":"The Snorble's uvula is a very delicate thing, because it contains the Snorble's third brain stem.

They even use the stones to somehow convert food into other useful materials!","234":"Jollies are capable of spitting these balls of sticky, disgusting goo at predators to keep them away. It rarely works.","235":"This tiny Jollychomp appears to be a baby. They must somehow lose their eyes when they reach adulthood. This makes no sense, but it must work for them.","236":"This tasty treat is belched out of the mouth of a Jollychomp under the right conditions. It smells and tastes fruity-licious!","237":"Powering up your Thrombopump with a few components from the Bawg allows you to extract these tough fibers. Salty!","238":"This little creature grows out of the enlarged pores of the Bawg. It doesn't seem happy to be removed from its home, but you obviously don't care.","239":"This plant-like organism somehow thrives in the acidic pools of the Bawg. It turns the acid into a bioluminescent glow, which it uses to lure in unsuspecting Plonktans to eat.","240":"Tiny creatures are living inside these tubes. They don't like being out of the Bawg's acid, but you don't really care.","241":"The acid of the Bawg has purified the healing essence of this Fathead.

It conducts electricity really well, but it's terrible at baking cakes.","245":"This projection of a Nurva is used to poke the eyes of things that wander nearby. As you look closer at it, it pokes you in the eye. You're not sure what you expected.","246":"This styrofoam-like tissue can be ripped from Nurvas, and it makes for great electrical insulation!","247":"This little pod can be jammed into the flesh of the Bawg to grow new Nurva. It's odd when you think about it, so you stop thinking about it.","248":"Level 21 Axe. You aren't sure which end to hold this thing by. It's pretty pointy no matter how you approach it.","249":"The legendary moustache of a Bamli. When you peer into it, you can see your own soul reflected back at you.","250":"You removed this horn forcibly from a Bamli's head. It was pretty horrifying. You're a monster.","251":"To aid in flight, the Bamli inflates its Flightbladder with absolutely nothing. Once the bladder is inflated, the Bamli becomes buoyant in the air and soars like a majestic eagle.","252":"The domesticated Bamli produces an excessive amount of this hormone. It's unclear what it's for.","253":"An unexploded Vomma baby. It adorably tries to tear your arm off whenever you pet it. Babies are so cute.","254":"Vomma are covered with these fleshy flaps. Their primary purpose seems to be for decoration. Lady Vommas love a man with big flaps.","255":"Domesticated Vomma produce these tasty balls of gelatin on a regular basis. They remind you a lot of tapioka.","256":"This is where Vomma babies are made. You're not sure why you felt compelled to pick it up and carry it around.","257":"Something is moving around under all that acid...","258":"This tube carries a blue liquid around inside the Bawg. It's really stretchy and rubbery. You could probably whip something really hard with it!","259":"This little guy latches onto Blubes and drinks the blood of the Bawg. It's pretty gross, but he doesn't seem too concerned.","260":"Plucked from the branches of an Artree, this potato-shaped saggy sack seems to be full of fat.","261":"By plunging this into the Bawg's flesh, you can foster the growth of new Artrees. Which you can then stab repeatedly with sharp tools.","262":"After prying this from the clutches of a vicious Blegh, you are able to examine it up-close. You have concluded that it is bumpy.","263":"Much like the bark of a tree, the bark of the Bawg's gigantic hairs is tough and dry. It appears to be flammable, but it would probably smell terrible to burn it.","264":"The Bawg has apparently never heard of conditioner.","265":"This was given to you by a friendly Pikkaye. Yes, that's right. Given.","266":"This thing was burrowed deep inside a giant hair. It makes you feel itchy just looking at it.","267":"Somehow, those giant spurs sticking out of the Bawg are able to develop gold chunks inside of them. You should investigate this further, for science.","268":"You were able to break this off of a spur. It's a very tough, shell-like thing, and it's super shiny. It would look cool to have a car made of this.","269":"You managed to tear this off the foundation of a Spur before you destroyed it. Kind of like a dentist.","270":"This must be how the Wojacks get around underground. It won't stop wiggling around.","271":"Although Wojacks spend a lot of time undergound, they appear to have very sophisticated eyeballs.","272":"Is it a tooth, claw, horn, or flower petal? The world may never know. But it smells delightful.","273":"This came out of a domesticated Wojacks's... spice... organ. When you sniff it, your eyes change color.","274":"The severed arm of a Wojack. It wasn't really using it, anyway.","275":"Tier 1 trowel. This trowel should come in handy for POPPING plants and stubborn organisms out of the ground! And that's about it. It's a trowel, what do you want?","276":"Tier 3 pickaxe. This pickaxe is insanely sturdy, for being made out of tentacles and plants!","277":"Tier 4 saw. The moustache of a Bamli is so rugged and manly that you can cut down Bonespurs and Hairbark with it! And lots of other stuff, too!","278":"Tier 2 fishing pole. This pole is made of the most resilient materials of the Bawg, so it should DEFINITELY be able to stand up to a little bit of acid.","279":"Tier 3 saw. The flora of the Bawg seem very resilient to your masterfully crafted Blastique saw, but this puppy should do the trick.","280":"By jamming a reed into a water balloon, you're now able to fling it with TREMENDOUS FORCE onto your seeds! Seeds love that kinda stuff, right?","281":"It's a door from your ship!","282":"It's a wall from your ship!","283":"This is how you talk with the Bureau of Shipping.","284":"It's where you get your Whizbox!","285":"Your trusty companion OF SCIENCE!","286":"This communications console has broken down and is now VERY DANGEROUS!","287":"This is great for clearing broken ship parts, and for stunning creatures at a distance!","288":"This door has broken down, and it's now shooting electricity everywhere!","289":"A wall from your ship.

You find that when you shove them into things, it hurts a lot.","298":"Level 17 Axe. You might think something like a floppy tentacle would make for a terrible axe. You might think WRONG.","299":"Level 19 Hammer. It's about time you gave those Snorbles a taste of their own saks.","300":"Level 21 Sword. This intuitively effective weapon can slice through even the mightiest of... Well, all kinds of stuff, really.","301":"Level 23 Axe. By harnessing the power of the Bamli, you've managed to assemble an axe that can strike down ALL WHO STAND BEFORE YOU!

You're the only person on this planet. But dang, does this bagchair look good.","312":"It's possible that sitting on this chair will cause certain parts of your body to become radioactive. RADIOACTIVELY AWESOME, THAT IS.","313":"It took a lot of walker blossoms to make this, but you reassure yourself that it was totally worth it somehow.","314":"With the power of WRITING ON WOOD PULP, you are now able to convey your love toward the Bureau of Shipping. Great job!","315":"Level 13 Glove. Wrapping your hands in the loving Vlaps of a Vomma makes you feel warm, safe, and secure.","316":"Level 13 Chest. You feel warm and cuddly when you wrap yourself in a majestic suit of Vlaps.","317":"Level 13 Pants. These chaps are exposed in the back, allowing you to enjoy a nice, cool breeze.","318":"Level 13 Helm. You think this hat makes you look super awesome. You might be right about that, but you might not.","319":"Using the focused power of firmified Jolly Fulmar, you're able to finely craft things with such immense detail that it hurts your eye sockets just thinking about it.","320":"Deploying this fake Vomma Baby Sack causes something magical to happen! Embiggens your Vomma to POWERFUL SIZE!","321":"This floor makes an awkward squishing noise as you rub your toes against it, but it feels nice.","322":"The shiny sheen of this floor makes you want to roll around on it, so you might as well.","323":"There's nothing quite like the bones of a thousand alien cow hippos to really add spice to a room.","324":"This amazing-looking chest will hold whatever you put in it! Except love. Nothing can contain love.","325":"Level 17 Helm. Looking at this helm makes you wonder if you'll ever be able to get it off. Good thing it's stylish, or you'd be concerned.","326":"Level 17 Chest. The suckers of the Throak tentacles constantly give you backrubs. It's nice.","327":"Level 17 Glove.

It probably uses the fur for knitting hats.","365":"It's unclear what laid this egg. But it is clear that it's packed with nutrients and goodies, like some kind of natural pinata.","366":"The flower of this plant is insanely heavy. The blossom climbs up the stalk, then smashes down into the ice to break off chunks, which the plant then consumes.","367":"The water inside overflows until it freezes over, creating a sort of cap. One the frozen cap is in place, the Geysir builds up tremendous pressure inside that is only relieved when the cap is removed.","368":"Something is stirring under the cold, icy waters.","369":"This flat, fish-like creature clings to ice chunks and blends in with them.

You also hear rumbling sounds nearby. Restores 7,268 HP.","377":"Instead of leaves, this plant grows a crazy amount of hair. The hair generates energy for the plant by blowing in the wind. It reminds you of one of your distant relatives.","378":"This tree twitches when hostile creatures come near it, but it never swings. You surmise that it might be a pacifist.","379":"It's unclear whether this is a type of coral, a plant, an animal, or something in between.

When the target gets close, it sits there and does nothing, because it's a mushroom.","391":"Orange goo that has seeped up through the cracks in the green crystals of the Tundra. It has since hardened... And it smells like squid.","392":"Although it looks like an adorable rabbit, it's just a camouflaged root vegetable. Ignore the fact that it screams when you eat it.

Or grams. It's very squirmy, so it's tough to get a read on it.","397":"This trunk sure can take a pounding.","398":"It's pretty jittery. It can only be calmed down by the rhythmic, explosive pounding of a Smashblossom.","399":"It has a convenient grip, almost as it if was made to be thrown by you and you alone. As you gaze upon the flailpod, you feel butterflies in your stomach. It was meant to be.","400":"The blackbark of a Flailtree is much stronger and more resilient than its backbark.","401":"The seed of a Flailtree. It's very aggressive and disagreeable. Better to bury it and get it over with.","402":"The Furgrasp uses these long, pointy appendages to rip tufts of fur from... something.","403":"These leaves are fibrous, almost as if they were woven together by a tiny person with tiny, tiny fingers. Like a baby, or perhaps a very small monkey.","404":"After murdering its father, the least you can do is plant this seed. Don't be a barbarian.","405":"A furgrasp must have ripped this tuft off of something... strange...","406":"Flungi use these roots to keep themselves aloft somehow. It seems like magic, so it probably is, according to Occam's razor.","407":"Based on the size and complexity of his brain, Flungi may be the most intelligent creatures in the universe. Too bad they can't move or speak!","408":"Flungi home in on these bees to deposit their spores, or something. Planting one of these in Furdle Frost should generate a Flungus, at any rate!","409":"This pod has avoided being exploded by your violent attacks. You sense that it is terrifed of you, and probably delicious.","410":"It's wet and sticky, like the goop that comes out of an egg. Oh, wait... that's EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.","411":"It's packed full of nutrients, like fat, cholesterol, and various poisons! It also seems to be glaring at you.","412":"This shell is one of the hardest substances you've seen since you began looking at it just a second ago.","413":"It demands that you bow before it and kiss its appendages.","414":"This little bugger will chop the back of your face off if you take your eyes off it for a second. Just to be safe, you should try it.","415":"This substance is harder than anything you've ever seen. The Magmites build their nests around this stuff, apparently hoping to mine it. So far they have never succeeded.","416":"You can't imagine what this might be useful for.","417":"This is just a pipe, made out of some type of organic plant matter. It becomes progressively floppier over time.","418":"This mossy stuff must do something to produce the pipes you always see protruding from it. BUT WHAT? Science will never know.","419":"The intense pressures inside Geysirs are SO CRAZY HIGH, they can turn just about anything into a diamond! Including whatever this was!","420":"When scrubbed down, this ball of crud yields a cornucopia of precious metals!","421":"This little weirdo can move REALLY fast. When it wants to. Which it doesn't. YOU CAN'T TELL IT WHAT TO DO.","422":"This table was built by Hewgodooko's bare hands. Or whatever he uses for this kind of thing. Lasers, probably. Bare lasers.","423":"This chair was found in one of Hewgodooko's bases. The craftsmanship is exquisite. Looking at this chair, you wonder whether Hewgodooko was once a skilled carpenter, and if so, why he would know how to build chairs if he can levitate.","424":"This lamp glows with infinite fuel, probably using some kind of mystical energy source known only to... whatever Hewgodooko is.","425":"Hewgodooko has some pretty big chests. This will come in handy for normal chest-based activities.","426":"A lamp from Hewgodooko's base that goes on the floor. It glows a beautiful teal. The color reminds you of toothpaste, or the ocean, or stuff like that.","427":"This lantern is so green, you wonder if it could possibly get any greener. The answer is yes... OR IS IT? No, it's not.","428":"This lantern is yella. Yella, like the colah of the skah on a nahce summa dah.","429":"This lantern glows a deep, reddish-orange. It reminds you of the fiery eyes of a demon you once loved.","430":"THIS HEWGOLANTERN IS MAGENTAMAAAAAZING! It's magenta.","431":"The color of this lantern is similar to the prison garb of inmates back home on Earth. Those were the days.","432":"Dis lamp has uh bluh gluh.","433":"This hologram stores a memory print of whatever the user exposes it to. Unfortunately, it's too sophisticated for your feeble mind to understand how to update the display. Still, it looks nice!","434":"Extracted from a domesticated Glaser, it works well to keep things tied up. Might as well not question a good thing.","435":"It's pointy and hums with energy. You wonder how it would feel to get poked by it.","436":"When a Glaser eats something unusual, its stomachs tie in knots. This seems like a disadvantage.","437":"It's extremely well insulated, like styrofoam. It also feels like styrofoam. You wonder if it's styrofoam. It might just be styrofoam.","438":"The heart of a Glaser's extreme energy powers, this charge hub would be able to power a small cell phone.","439":"It bounces and makes wet slapping noises when you throw it against things.","440":"It probably hurt when this was ripped from a Shirk's face, but Shirks probably don't have emotions or self-awareness, so it's not that big of a deal.","441":"You managed to squeeze this whopping sodium chunk out of a domesticated Shirk's salt gland. And you only nearly lost a limb!","442":"These feathers give Shirks their beautiful, glorious majesty. They truly are nature's most beautiful carnivorous flying bird shark monsters.","443":"Shirks like an extra pinch of salt on their meals, so this salt gland really comes in handy for such occasions.","444":"Legends say that Lyffs will give shards of their crystals to those they consider friends. What legends? You know... the legends.","445":"The only organ a Lyff uses to get around. It makes a loud 'BOING' sound when you pull it back and release.","446":"The skin is quite thin, but it's covered in an incredibly thick mat of fur. So thick, in fact, that it might not be fur at all. It might just be more skin.","447":"When a Lyff wants to go for a dip, this puppy keeps it afloat. It's so effective that Lyffs can't swim more than a foot or so underwater without popping back up.","448":"It's coarse and covered in bumps. If you rub it on your cheek, nothing happens.","449":"Torn from the chest cavity of a Gallum, this warp core might be useful for something involving warping.","450":"These ribs provide protection for the warp core of a Gallum. Not enough protection, apparently, because you easily pried it out with your bare hands.","451":"This meat holds the ribs of a Gallum together. Throw that in a pot with some salt and pepper, and baby, you've got a stew going.","452":"This would be one of the toughest substances known to mankind, if it were substantially tougher... and known to mankind.","453":"You ripped that Gulanti a new, slightly bigger blowhole in exactly the same place as its old one.","454":"It gets warm when you hold fire to it, but it stops getting warm when you take the fire away.","455":"Gulantis probably use these serrated edges to tear the meat from the bones of their innocent victims, or possibly for carpentry.","456":"You know that feeling when you rub your socks on the carpet, then touch something, and it zaps you? Touching this thing feels nothing like that.","457":"Whatever you put this next to, it makes that thing seem way more awesome. It's extracted from a domesticated Gulanti!","458":"When you gaze upon the lustrous sheen of the shell, you begin to hallucinate that you are stranded alone on a planet, fighting for your survival while trying to defeat a limbless alien.","459":"Acquired from a domesticated Slurb. Is it mucus? Is it electric? Yes.","460":"Slurbs probably use these to amplify their aerobatic spins. This magnet has impeccable craftsmanship.","461":"It's so insanely pointy, you could probably attach it to something, then poke stuff with that thing, and it would hurt a lot.","462":"It's not very firm under normal conditions, but it hardens instantly when exposed to explosions.","463":"Much like a grill lighter, this gland sends sparks into the Blastcrab's body and lights... whatever is in there.","464":"Pulled from a blast tube of a domesticated Blastcrab, this compound makes your breath flammable!","465":"It's tough and chewy! Almost too chewy...","466":"This high-energy goo binds the cosmic energy of the Gallum's crystals together. If you treat a domesticated Gallum well, it might give you some!","467":"You've packed about as much glow juice into one place as you possibly can. This thing should stay lit for... FRICKIN' EONS.","468":"Now you're crafting with Wompit parts!","469":"Tier 4 pickaxe. The hair bristles pleasantly against the palm of your hand as you wield it.","470":"If you put a piece of bread into it, you would end up with more pieces of bread.","471":"Level 25 Hammer. The plumage on the hilt really gives it a nice counterbalanced heft.","472":"Level 25 Helm. The last thing your enemies will remember is the shining glimmer of your beautiful shirkbeak smile.","473":"Level 25 Chest. Smashblossom parts can really take a pounding, and now, so can you!","474":"Level 25 Glove. The yolk is pretty sticky, but it keeps the gloves firmly cemented onto your hands. It's a trade-off.","475":"Level 25 Pants. The blubber does a great job of trapping the natural heat of your spicy legs, which is pretty important in the cold of the Tundra.","476":"It's a patchy job, but most Shirks are just dumb enough to fall for it. Embiggens your Shirk to POWERFUL SIZE!","477":"Be sure not to put your face in front of this while it's running, unless you're into horrifying spa treatments.","478":"Like the chemistry set you had as a kid, but morbid.","479":"Tier 3 trowel. Antlers and hooves are terrible at prying things off the ground, until you combine them. In a sense, they're like the mustard and mayonnaise of a deviled egg.","480":"The sagtatoe container really brings out the flavonoids. Restores 6,521 HP.","481":"Juicing up with this bad boy lets you SUCK THE LIFE FROM EVERYONE AROUND YOU! 2% chance to regain health upon striking. Elixir lasts 20 minutes.","482":"With this much protein, you could seriously consider getting into squats. Restores 17,894 HP.","483":"This disgusting fluid makes you REALLY UPSET. 3% chance to go berserk upon striking. Elixir lasts 20 minutes.","484":"It's dirty.","485":"You can plant seeds in it! It's so furdle and durty!.","486":"Stabbing a Squeti with a spine makes for a great kebab! Oh, but remind your pet to remove the skewer before eating it. Restores 66,240 HP.","487":"If there's one thing a Glaser can't resist, it's a space traveler in tight spandex flinging a ball of awkwardly-assembled objects at it. Embiggens your Glaser to POWERFUL SIZE!","488":"Level 27 Sword. Although Glaser stomachs don't make for very good building components, they work much better once you stab them with everything else.","489":"Level 27 Pants. The stranglers keep all your parts packed in tight!","490":"Level 27 Chest. It protect, lifts, and supports! Your dignity, that is.","491":"Level 27 Helm. It'll protect your face so hard, you won't even know what hit you. Seriously, you'll have no idea.","492":"Level 27 Glove. The high levels of acid on the inside will definitely render your hands soft and tender. Everyone loves soft hands!","493":"By dumping slurry into the Slurrifier, you'll be able to clean it up and extract something useful from it.","494":"It seems that the slurry you get from geysirs might contain valuable resources. This station will let you extract all the delicious goodness!","495":"This was covered in some Geysir Slurry, and you managed to clean it up. It's pretty rough around the edges, but it might be good for something.","496":"It's hard and scratch-proof, and polished to a perfect sheen. Nothing you do seems to dent it, and it hums gently when you come near it.","497":"This toxic goo is a primary component of slurry. It sticks to everything it touches, including your nostrils.","498":"Tier 3 fishing pole. It's long, hard, and thorny. Like a fishing pole should be.","499":"Fully equipped for all your tumbling needs, this Tumbler even comes with a cupholder! In the sense that you can put a cup near it.","500":"It smells like waffles without syrup. Reduces physical damage taken by 15%. Elixir lasts 20 minutes.","501":"Level 29 Axe. When swung hard enough, ice skates can become deadly weapons. Like most things, probably.","502":"Level 29 Helm. You could put a lot of eyes out with these things.","503":"Level 29 Chest. Nothing insulates your saucy torso like a Squeti.","504":"Level 29 Glove. Poofy shoulderpads are IN! Fashion is cyclical, right? ... Right?","505":"Level 29 Pants. Sloots with the fur, to protect your beautiful calves from the biting cold.","506":"Slurbs rely on magnetism to powercharge their leaps. Embiggens your Slurb to POWERFUL SIZE!","507":"Tier 5 saw. The jagged spines of Slurbs make for an amazing saw. They are also great conversation starters and enders!","508":"Good thing it runs on its own, or you'd end up with a lot of disfiguring scars!","509":"Level 31 Hammer. Although soft and filled with air, flungus pods can do some serious damage in the very, very long term. Years, maybe.","510":"Lyffs are super playful, so this toy-ish baubley thing should win one over pretty easily. Embiggens your Lyff to POWERFUL SIZE!","511":"Level 31 Helm. Wearing this cap infuses your cerebrum with the mental faculties of a Flungus. It also removes your depth perception, which is a plus.","512":"Level 31 Chest. It's tight, which is what makes it so nice.","513":"Level 31 Glove. Wrapping a Lyff tongue around your hand has augmented the sounds of your slaps to become very satisfying.","514":"Level 31 Pants. The fluff feels good in between your toes. Or it would, if you had some.","515":"Tier 5 pickaxe. Be careful not to poke your parts with the spiky ball part of the pick.","516":"Pump it up and process it down! This bad boy will turn all that bubblin' crude into whatever your little heart desires!","517":"It's hard, round, and smooth. Despite its toughness, it has just enough give to make for some pretty good bounces.","518":"Level 33 Helm. It's just heavy enough that you might break your neck wearing it. That's how you know it's good.","519":"Level 33 Chest. It's strong enough for a man, and also strong enough for a woman. Because women and men are equal.","520":"Level 33 Glove. It looks sharp on the outside, but it's even sharper on the inside. You should seek medical attention.","521":"Level 33 Pants. These boots will grant you the style of one eagle and the finesse of another eagle, high-fiving as they soar through space.","522":"Level 33 Sword. Look at this sword. You could poke the whole world with this thing.","523":"It makes horrible squealing noises as it extracts oil from the waters of the Tundra. It makes you feel like dancing.","524":"Priming your Bagpump with an Icequill lets you extract this from the water. It's oily on the outside, and oilier on the inside!","525":"Tier 4 trowel. The grip is pretty slippery, but it should get the job done.","526":"Blastcrabs care about one thing only, and that's burning everything. Embiggens your Blastcrab to POWERFUL SIZE!","527":"It runs pretty hot, but not very fast. You could probably beat it in a marathon, or with a stick.","528":"Level 35 Axe. It's heavy, awkward, pointy, and dangerous. Just like your ex-spouse.","529":"Level 35 Helm. It fits so snugly over your skull, you can barely hear, think, see, or breathe. So protective!","530":"Level 35 Chest. It grips your ribs with the strength of a thousand dung beetles!","531":"Level 35 Glove. The blowhole makes for a great seal, and the hard outer covering makes for a great hard outer covering! All in all, 3/5 stars.","532":"Level 35 Pants. Having a blowhole wrapped around your thigh reminds you of your college days.","533":"Gulantis love hide and seek. Maybe this little trick will scare one! Embiggens your Gulanti to POWERFUL SIZE!","534":"Take your Gallum to the next level OF PUZZLING ACTION! Embiggens your Gallum to POWERFUL SIZE!","535":"It can hold in a lot of heat, though it gets sticky after a lot of use. It could use a good rub-down from time to time.","536":"It pulls together all manner of things, strips them into strips, and weaves them together into a weave. BRILLIANT!","537":"All you need is the right attitude, a bit of elbow grease, and an elaborate workstation made of the skin of giant inflatable aliens.","538":"Spinning. It makes the world go round.","539":"It's only after you've burned everything that you're free to do anything. Grants a 10% chance to set enemies on fire.","540":"Imbue your attacks with THROAK TENTACLE POWERS!

Your face, not the floor.","578":"It's pretty hard to walk on, on account of it being made of huge balls. But hey, it's the price you pay to walk on huge balls.","579":"You feel like if you ran at it hard enough, it would give way. Better get started!","580":"It squishes when you press your face all up on it. Probably not the soundest of construction materials, but what are you gonna do?","581":"It's so shiny you can see your reflection in it! That must be useful, somehow.","582":"It's more dense than the densest of black holes. Fortunately it isn't one, or you would have fallen in by now.","583":"It's tough enough to withstand a hurricane, but gentle enough that you could trust it to look after your kids.","584":"It's the strongest material in the universe. It makes no sense that you were able to craft it into this shape.","585":"Made of the toughest flatstone around, this door will keep all your stuff safe from burglars!","586":"When it retracts, red goo squirts out. It smells like candy!","587":"This door probably couldn't do much to keep anything out, but it sure feels great!","588":"The sun reflects off it in such a blindingly bright way, it's hard to even open the thing.

Unless they open it.","592":"You are using the trusty Bureau of Shipping Self-Sustaining Survival Station Series S-5! It'll get you started on this hostile alien planet.","593":"There is KNOWLEDGE inside this box!","594":"An NPC!","595":"It might be good to build a few of these, in case you end up with a cruise ship in your possession.","596":"This is where you keep all the books you tell everyone you've read!","597":"This makes you momentarily forget how unimportant you are!","598":"Touching this shrine makes your legs feel all tingly.

WHAT MORE DO YOU WANT?","611":"Standing near it makes you want to throw your hands in the air, almost as if you simply don't care.","612":"Putting your eye up to it leaves a gross ring of goo around your eye socket.","613":"It floats in the water, despite being made of ultra-dense materials. There must be some science in there!","614":"The glowing orbs are hypnotic. You can feel yourself drooling as you watch it.","615":"It stares into the soul of everything in the universe.","616":"Even before it is fully hatched, the Bamli sports a proud moustache.","617":"It's hot to the touch. Like an egg, but one that's hot to the touch.","618":"The egg is made of crystal chunks, just like its parents. It seems shy. You know, for an egg.","619":"While being carried, the egg makes high-pitched gurgling noises.","620":"No matter how much you dab it with paper towels, it remains perpetually moist.","621":"Something adorable is probably going to come out of this. That, or a hideous flying insect.","622":"The blowhole must be there for a reason. What that might be... nobody knows.","623":"When threatened, the egg makes a high-pitched ululating sound. Like father, like son.","624":"This shell looks the same as the exoskeleton of the parents!","625":"The baby Shirk inside screeches violently.","626":"You have to be careful while handling it, so as to not impale your entire everything.","627":"It squishes like an airbag. It's almost as if there's nothing inside it...","628":"It gets stuck to your hand when you touch it. Hopefully it's not permanent.","629":"It wobbles like jelly when you slap it. You should probably not slap it.","630":"The egg is covered in a sticky substance, and it smells like the bathroom of a bar at closing time.","631":"The egg seems ready to zoom off into the sunset.","632":"It's covered in suckers! Probably to keep it attached to... whatever.","633":"You'd think Wompits wouldn't lay eggs, on account of them being mammals. You'd be wrong.","634":"It crackles with electricity. You get tiny static shocks the whole time you're holding it.","635":"This is going to get moist.","636":"As the saying goes, if you want to hatch a Glutterfly, you gotta build one of these.","637":"Tartil eggs stick to everything they touch.

No, those are... love-pokers.","657":"THE FLAVOR MAKES YOUR MOUTH EXPLODE WITH HAPPINESS! For a couple seconds.
